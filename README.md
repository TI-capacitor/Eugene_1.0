# Eugene v0.1.0 - Pre-alpha

### Planned changes(v0.2.0-pre-alpha):

- Elimination of `delay()` in place of `millis()` algorithm
- Elimination of LCD module and ultrasound sensing to focus on movement development
- Addition of Bluetooth module zs-040 to control the rover via `Serial Bluetooth Terminal`
- Implementation of hardware interrupt for state machine to toggle between ultrasound and BT mode with push button
- Addition of classes for abstraction and cleaner main script
- Better power management using 3.7v 18650 batteries in 2S configuration
