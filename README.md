# Eugene 1.0 — Mechatronics Rover (Arduino Uno)
A small two-motor rover built for a mechatronics project: ultrasonic sensing + DC motor drive + a 3D-printed chassis. Simple, practical, and slightly silly on purpose.

## Overview
**Eugene 1.0** is a beginner-friendly mobile robot platform designed to practice core mechatronics integration:
- Embedded control on an **Arduino Uno**
- Distance sensing with an **ultrasonic sensor**
- Motor control via an **L298N dual H-bridge driver**
- Assembly using a **3D-printed chassis** design
